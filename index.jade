        h1.humanjs HumanJS

        h1 Introduction

        p There are lots of toolkits for building single page apps or "Native HTML5 Apps" if you will. It seems they're either too generic and unopinionated or too tightly coupled or require a lot of knowledge and understanding of the framework. After having built lots of single page apps with various tools at <a href="http://andyet.com">&yet</a> we've surmised that the ideal seems to lie somewhere in the middle.

        p Ultimately we'd like something that is comprised of lots of independent little tools that each to one thing (see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">Unix philosophy</a>).

        p That said, starting with a group of completely unassembled little pieces is inefficient because there are lots of patterns common to <em>most</em> apps. So we need an opinionated starting point.

        p Enter HumanJS. It's not a framework per se, it's a bag of pre-assembled little tools that you're free to rip apart and add to with the following goals in mind.

        h2 Goals

        ul
          li Provides an opinionated starting point for an app
          li Easy to get up and running
          li Minimal framework-specific knowledge required (knowing JavaScript well gets you 95% there)
          li Minimal magic
          li Solve the develpment workflow problems out of the box:
            ul
              li Unminified and re-built automatically in develpment
              li Minfied, cached for production use
              li Switching between the two with a single config flag
          li Use node.js to simplify develpment
          li 100% client rendered
          li Readability
          li App can be served as static content by any server (node.js not required in production)
          li Easy to collaborate on:
            ul 
              li Clear file structure where everything has a logical place
              li Proper seperation of concerns
          li Use npm + browserify for package management but still play nicely with non-common JS libraries.

        h1 Quick Start Guide

        ol
          li <a href="http://nodejs.org/">install node.js</a>
          li install humanjs
            p
              code $ npm install humanjs -g
          li run ``humanjs`` to create your new app folder, build your project scaffolding, and run your app.
            p
              code $ humanjs
          li open your browser to: <code>http://localhost:3000</code>

          li that's it!

        h2 What's included?

        ul
          li Well-architected shell of a single page app to serve as a starting point for your app.
          li A solution for using jade templates and templatizer to pre-compile client templates.
          li A fully functional development environment that will watch for changes. You just modify and refresh (without manual build steps).
          li Changing one flag in your config puts it in production mode which builds and serves minfied, uniquely named, and permanently cachable static files.
          li A clientside routing system using HTML5 pushState.
          li A main layout template is rendered by the main view that includes a page container where page views are rendered as the user navigates to different URLs in the app.
          li An example of rendering a collection of models in a container.
          li A mock REST API to demonstrate how you might talk to an API to fetch data.
          li A solution for declaritive binding of model properties to views, that is <em>completely</em> decoupled from the template engine. See human-view below for more details.
          li A solution for creating readable, type-checked, and very explicitly defined models. This is hugely important in team enviroments where you need somewhere to reference what is being stored on your models. See human-model for more detail.
