        h1.humanjs HumanJS

        h2 Quick Start

        ol
          li <a href="http://nodejs.org/">install node.js</a>
          li install humanjs
            p
              code $ npm install humanjs -g
          li run ``humanjs`` to create your new app folder, build your project scaffolding, and run your app.
            p
              code $ humanjs
          li open your browser to: <code>http://localhost:3000</code>

          li that's it!

        h3 What's included?

        ul
          li Well-architected shell of a single page app to serve as a starting point for your app.
          li A solution for using jade templates and templatizer to pre-compile client templates.
          li A fully functional development environment that will watch for changes. You just modify and refresh (without manual build steps).
          li Changing one flag in your config puts it in production mode which builds and serves minfied, uniquely named, and permanently cachable static files.
          li A clientside routing system using HTML5 pushState.
          li A main layout template is rendered by the main view that includes a page container where page views are rendered as the user navigates to different URLs in the app.
          li An example of rendering a collection of models in a container.
          li A mock REST API to demonstrate how you might talk to an API to fetch data.
          li A solution for declaritive binding of model properties to views, that is <em>completely</em> decoupled from the template engine. See human-view below for more details.
          li A solution for creating readable, type-checked, and very explicitly defined models. This is hugely important in team enviroments where you need somewhere to reference what is being stored on your models. See human-model for more detail.


        h2 Introduction

        p There are lots of toolkits for building single page apps or "Native HTML5 Apps" if you will. It seems they're either too generic and unopinionated or too tightly coupled or require a lot of knowledge and understanding of the framework. After having built lots of single page apps with various tools at <a href="http://andyet.com">&yet</a> we've surmised that the ideal seems to lie somewhere in the middle. 

        p Ultimately we'd like something that is comprised of lots of independent little tools that each to one thing (see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">Unix philosophy</a>).

        p That said, starting with a group of completely unassembled little pieces is inefficient because there are lots of patterns common to <em>most</em> apps. So we need an opinionated starting point.

        p That's how HumanJS was born. Some of it simply uses <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> as is.

        p It's not really a framework, it's a bag of pre-assembled little tools that you're free to rip apart and add to. 

        h3 Goals

        ul
            li Readability
            li Flexibility
            li Minimal magic
            li 100% client rendered
            li Use node.js to simplify develpment
            li App can be served as static content by any server (node.js not required in production)
            li Should requrie minimal framework-level knowledge (knowing javascript well gets you 95% there)
            li Easy to collaborate on:
              ul 
                li Clear file structure where everything has a logical place.
                li Proper seperation of concerns
            li Provide an opinionated starting point
            li Use npm + browserify for package management but still play nicely with non-common JS libraries.
